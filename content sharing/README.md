# Content Sharing

You can share anything you want ranging from mini-projects to short stories.

This is your space to showcase anything you want.

Just create a **.json** file inside the "content sharing" folder and add links to anything you want to share. 
example :

```json
{
    "Resources" : ["https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston","https://docs.github.com/"],
    "Projects" : ["https://github.com/torvalds/linux"],
    "Images" : ["https://tinyurl.com/y45lx6oc"],
    "Websites" : ["https://www.google.com/"]
}
```
